1.	Introduction
•	What is an audio signal?
•	How is the audio recorded from a computer microphone?
- ADC
•	What is sample width, sample rate(frequency), decibels?
•	How these things affect the quality of the audio?
•	What is a spectrogram and how to interpret it?
•	Audio formats and how they compress the audio?

How does the Fourier transform work?
- Provide one (or more) examples with code
- Optionally, show plots of some common functions (sine, step, pulse, sinc, gaussian) and their Fourier spectrums

2.	Filters
•	High-pass / low-pass
•	Band-pass / band-stop
•	Background noise suppression
•	How noise cancelling in headphones work?

3.	Audio effects
•	Reverb, chorus, delay, etc. and how they work?
•	What are convolutions and how to apply them to audio signals?

4.	Audio Analysis Tools
•	Pitch Detection: Implement algorithms to detect the pitch of the audio.
•	Beat Detection: Analize the audio to find the beats and tempo.
•	Harmony and Melody Analysis: Extract musical features like harmony and melody from the audio.


*	Create a class called AudioProcessing. 
*	Implement all the filters, effects and analysis tools as a functions that accept audio signal and its parameters. 
*	Provide visualisations to the functions of the input signal and the output signal in waveform and spectrogram format. 
*	Provide audio examples to each of the function before and after processing the audio.

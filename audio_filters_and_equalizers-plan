1.	Introduction
*	What is an audio signal? *
*	What is sample width, sample rate(frequency), decibels? *
*	How these things affect the quality of the audio? 
*	What is a spectrogram and how to interpret it?
* What is time domain? What is frequency domain?

How does the Fourier transform work?
- Provide one (or more) examples with code
- Optionally, show plots of some common functions (sine, step, pulse, sinc, gaussian) and their Fourier spectrums

2.	Filters
•	High-pass / low-pass
•	Band-pass / band-stop

3.	Audio effects
•	Reverb, chorus, delay, etc. and how they work?
•	What are convolutions and how to apply them to audio signals?

4. What is an Equalizer?

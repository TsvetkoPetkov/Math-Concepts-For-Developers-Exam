    "**An audio signal** refers to an electrical representation of sound waves that can be captured, transmitted, stored, or processed by electronic devices. It carries the essential information of the sound, including its frequency, amplitude, and phase, allowing us to perceive and reproduce auditory experiences. In simple terms, when we speak, play music, or any other sound is produced, it creates vibrations in the air. These vibrations travel as sound waves and eventually reach our ears. An audio signal converts these sound waves into an electrical signal that can be used by various technological devices, such as speakers."

It is common to mix the delayed output with the original input, thereby producing two copies of the sound. For this reason the basic delay is also sometimes known as an echo effect (though as we will see, the perception of echo also depends on the delay time).\n",
